        A bot is a program that automatically completes an action based on specific triggers and algorithms. A
        chatbot
        is a computer program that is designed to simulate human conversation. Users communicate with these tools
        using
        a
        chat interface or via voice, just like they would converse with another person. Chatbots interpret the words
        given to them by a person and provide a pre-set answer.
